# 🧠 Personal DSA Learning Repository

> A personal Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository where I document problem-solving methods, thought processes, and similar problems that follow the same approach.

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository is organized by topic. Each directory contains the source code for the problem, often including multiple solutions (e.g., Brute Force vs. Optimized) and a specific README explaining the logic.

## 📂 General Programs

| Problem Directory | Description |
